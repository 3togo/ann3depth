# ANN for live depth estimation from video streams

Specific
  ~ Create an ANN to estimate depth maps for a self recorded video

Measurable
  ~ Quality of the estimate is the difference between the depth value of the
  Kinect and our predicted value

Attainable
  ~ There is work available for single images and the information of the
  connected frames could be used to improve the result

Relevant
  ~ Depth information can be used for many tasks: robot navigation, object segmentation,
  enrichment for regular cameras ...

Time-bound
  ~ Given by the time of the semester
